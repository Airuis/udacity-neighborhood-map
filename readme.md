## Instructions

Load the map by opening the index.html file in your browser of choice.

This map is designed to show you the best areas to look for cabins in Arizona, if you're so inclined. The points are limited primarily to areas in the north, north central and east of the state, since everywhere else gets unbearably hot in the summer months (a good half the year in sunny Arizona). 

Included in each point is the name of the area, elevation statistics (courtesy of Wikipedia), and the current temperature (courtesy of the OpenWeatherMap API). The map also includes a list of all of the locations that can be toggled on by clicking the "Areas of interest" button, and you can also filter by region using the dropdown menu. 

## Dependencies

This map relies on Knockout.js (knockoutjs.com) to run properly, as well as the Google Maps API.

## Credits

The base HTML, CSS, and Javascript files were created by me, Stephen Harding.

Much of the base map coding was taken from the Udacity tutorials and modified by me.

Fetch example coding was modified from the coding found at https://davidwalsh.name/fetch.
